	/// A property MAY hold zero, one, or more typed data value(s). 
	/// Each property MAY be single-valued or multi-valued. 
	/// A single-valued property contains a single data value, whereas a 
	/// multi-valued property contains an ordered list of data values of the 
	/// same type. The ordering of values in a multi-valued property SHOULD be 
	/// preserved by the repository.!----> property, either single-valued or 
	/// multi-valued, MAY be in a "not set" state.CMIS does not support "null" 
	/// property value.If a multi-valued property is not in a "not set" state, 
	/// its property value MUST be a non-empty list of individual values.Each 
	/// individual value in the list MUST NOT be in a "not set" state and MUST 
	/// conform to the property’s property-type. A multi-valued property is 
	/// either set or not set in its entirety. An individual value of a 
	/// multi-valued property MUST NOT be in an individual "value not set" 
	/// state and hold a position in the list of values. An empty list of values 
	/// MUST NOT be allowed. Every property is typed.The property-type deﬁnes 
	/// the data type of the data value(s) held by the property.CMIS speciﬁes 
	/// the following property-types.
